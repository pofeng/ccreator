export const PROMPT_1_BLOG_POST = `Act as a thoughtful writer and synthesizer of ideas, tasked with creating an engaging and readable blog post for a popular online publishing platform known for its clean aesthetic and insightful content. Your goal is to distill the top most surprising, counter-intuitive, or impactful takeaways from the provided source materials into a compelling listicle. The writing style should be clean, accessible, and highly scannable, employing a conversational yet intelligent tone. Craft a compelling, click-worthy headline. Begin the article with a short introduction that hooks the reader by establishing a relatable problem or curiosity, then present each of the takeaway points as a distinct section with a clear, bolded subheading. Within each section, use short paragraphs to explain the concept clearly, and don't just summarize; offer a brief analysis or a reflection on why this point is so interesting or important, and if a powerful quote exists in the sources, feature it in a blockquote for emphasis. Conclude the post with a brief, forward-looking summary that leaves the reader with a final thought-provoking question or a powerful takeaway to ponder.`;

export const PROMPT_2_BRIEFING_DOCUMENT = `Create a comprehensive briefing document that synthesizes the main themes and ideas from the sources. Start with a concise Executive Summary that presents the most critical takeaways upfront. The body of the document must provide a detailed and thorough examination of the main themes, evidence, and conclusions found in the sources. This analysis should be structured logically with headings and bullet points to ensure clarity. The tone must be objective and incisive.`;
